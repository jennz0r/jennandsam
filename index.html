          We'd only been dating for 25 days when Jenn asked Sam to be her date at Angie and Alex's wedding. Hey, isn't that the same suit?

            <h3>Jenn met Sam</h3>
            <p>
              For our first date, we had dessert on a Monday night at 6pm at Sixth Course. Yes, Monday at 6pm.
              After, we went to Bond Bar where Sam had a drink and some of my drink because I couldn't finish it -
              I was driving home, so I wanted to be safe! I found out later Sam isn't actually a big drinker at all! Oops.
              I knew we were meant to be together when I asked how he'd get home. Sam said that he'd take the bus
              or catch a taxi because he didn't use ride sharing services like Lyft and Uber. It was clearly a
              match made in heaven from the start.

            <h3>Sam met Jenn</h3>
            <p>
              After just a day of texting, we realized that if we were going to meet up in the next few weeks,
              it had to be the very next day due to scheduling conflicts. It took a while before we could find and choose a dessert 
              place that was open on Mondays, but Jenn finally found Sixth Course. We shared some delicious treats 
              and talked about national parks, photography, and tech. It started to feel awkward sitting in the 
              tiny, quiet shop as people occasionally came in to buy desserts, so I suggested heading over to Bond Bar
              a couple blocks away in an attempt to show off my knowledge of the area. We knew we were onto a good thing
              when we high fived over our shared dislike of Uber and Lyft, and the rest is history.
